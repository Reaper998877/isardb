// Isar is an ACID database, meaning it guarantees:
// Atomicity → all-or-nothing
// Consistency → DB always valid
// Isolation → no interference from other operations
// Durability → data stays safe
// To guarantee this, all write operations must happen inside a transaction.

Step 1 : Add dependencies in pubspec.yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8

  path_provider: ^2.1.3          

  isar_community: ^3.3.0         

  isar_community_flutter_libs: ^3.3.0   

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter

  isar_community_generator: ^3.3.0   

  build_runner: ^2.4.6      



Step 2 : Create model. (Here m_student.dart)
# Model is necessary for organizing data in isar db.
See m_student.dart (Change according to requirements)



Step 3 : Open Terminal and run below command 
command => flutter pub run build_runner build 

'modelname.g.dart' file will be created in the same directory, where the model file is.
Here it is m_student.g.dart



Step 4 : In main.dart file write below code

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  runApp(MyApp());
}



Step 5 : Create Controller to perform CRUD operations.
See c_student.dart



Step 6 : Using controller.
See v_student.dart
